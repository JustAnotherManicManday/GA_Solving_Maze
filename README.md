# GA_Solving_Maze

# Hello!
# This program creates random mazes and then solves them using a genetic algorithm. It uses pygame to create a nice ui, so we can see the mazes being solved in real time.
# It is made in Python 3.8.8, and I wrote it on a pc running Windows 10 Home, Version	10.0.19042 Build 19042.

# I haven't had any time to clean up the code yet, so it is all very messy. If it's a massive problem for you, shoot me a message and I'll place it higher on the priority
# list. And likewise, message me if you want to discuss any bits!

# A lot of the pygame maze related code was adapted from this tutorial - https://pythonspot.com/maze-in-pygame/
# And I also used Orestis Zekai's implementation of the Randomized Prim Algorithm to generate random mazes, https://github.com/OrWestSide/python-scripts/blob/master/maze.py
# So big thankyou's for their work!
